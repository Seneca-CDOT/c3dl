        <h1><a href="http://www.c3dl.org">C3DL</a>Picking Back-Bearing Test</h1>
    
        <p>
            This pages tests to make sure that picking does not detect points behind the camera.<br />
            An issue was identified where an object that extended behind the camera could have<br />
            the portion behind the camera show up as picked.  This occured because the ray used<br />
            for picking did not determine the direction from the source to the object it hit.<br />
            In short, a mirror image of the ray was being fired in the opposite direction and<br />
            hitting things behind the camera.  Clicking slightly above the end of the road<br />
            that projects into the scene (and behind the camera) caused it to show up as picked<br />
            (and start spinning).  This should no longer happen.<br />
